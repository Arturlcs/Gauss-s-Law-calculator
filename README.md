A calculator with graphical representation option for electric fields emitted by a non-conducting sphere using Gauss's Law for electrostatics in a one point of a Gauss's Surface.

## ðŸš€ Functionalitys

- The main features of this program is are: 
    - Calculator of the eletric field in and out of a non-conducting sphere using Gauss's Law 
    - The graphical representation of the field in a range in and out of a non-conducting shepere unsing the Gauss's Law 
    - Interative interface
    - Numeric validation
- The user can do:
    - Calculate the fiel in and out of a non-conducting sphere using Gauss's Law
    - Creat a graphic of the field in and out of a non-conducting sphere using Gauss's Law 
    - The user can fix a point in graphic and see how de field reacts 

## ðŸ“¦ prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or supperior

- Libraries
    - Numpy 
    - Matplotlib
    - scypy
    
## Details
- The unitys are in IS
- The graphic of the field out of the sphere is in Log scale because of the non linearity of the curve
- The graphic of the field in the sphere is are on normal scale, because the naturaly the representation is linear
